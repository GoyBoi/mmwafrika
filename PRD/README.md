# PRD FILE UPDATE NOTICE

The PRD file located at `/PRD/prd.md` contains outdated design specifications that conflict with our current implementation. 

Key differences:
1. The PRD specifies a color palette that doesn't align with our current African-inspired design system
2. The typography specifications don't match our current implementation
3. The component specifications are outdated

Our current implementation follows the design system documented in:
- `/documentation/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`
- `/documentation/COMPONENT_LIBRARY.md`

Please refer to these documents for the current design specifications rather than the PRD file.
