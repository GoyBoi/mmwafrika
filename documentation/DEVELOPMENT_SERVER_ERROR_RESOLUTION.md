# DEVELOPMENT SERVER ERROR RESOLUTION

## Problem Description
The webpack development server was failing to start properly, returning "HTTP 1.1 426 Upgrade Required" when accessed. Investigation revealed several issues:

1. **Port Conflicts**: VS Code was already using ports 3000 and 3001
2. **Incorrect Configuration**: The package.json start script was pointing to a non-existent webpack.dev.js file
3. **Conflicting Files**: Both webpack.config.js and webpack.dev.js existed with different configurations

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Port Conflict**: Ports 3000 and 3001 were already in use by VS Code
2. **Misconfigured Scripts**: package.json referenced a webpack configuration file that didn't align with our main webpack.config.js
3. **Configuration Duplication**: Multiple webpack configuration files caused confusion and conflicts

## Solutions Implemented

1. **Changed Port**: Updated webpack.config.js to use port 3003, avoiding conflicts with VS Code
2. **Fixed Package.json**: Updated the start script to reference the correct configuration file (webpack.config.js)
3. **Removed Conflicting File**: Deleted webpack.dev.js to eliminate configuration conflicts
4. **Verified Dependencies**: Confirmed all required webpack dependencies were installed

## Changes Made

### webpack.config.js
```javascript
// Changed from:
port: 3001,

// To:
port: 3003,
```

### package.json
```json
// Changed from:
"start": "webpack serve --config webpack.dev.js --mode development",

// To:
"start": "webpack serve --config webpack.config.js --mode development",
```

### File Cleanup
- Removed conflicting webpack.dev.js file

## Verification
After implementing these fixes:

1. ✅ Development server starts without errors
2. ✅ Server responds with HTTP 200 OK on port 3003
3. ✅ HTML content is served correctly
4. ✅ Bundle.js is compiled and served
5. ✅ React components are properly loaded

## Lessons Learned

1. **Port Management**: Always check for port conflicts before starting development servers
2. **Configuration Consistency**: Maintain a single source of truth for webpack configuration
3. **Package.json Scripts**: Keep script references up-to-date with actual file structure
4. **Regular Cleanup**: Remove unused or conflicting configuration files periodically

## Prevention for Future

1. **Port Selection**: Use ports higher than 3003 to avoid conflicts with common IDEs
2. **Configuration Management**: Maintain a single webpack configuration file
3. **Documentation**: Keep documentation updated when configuration changes are made
4. **Regular Audits**: Periodically review and clean up configuration files
