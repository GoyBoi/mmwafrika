# VISIBILITY AND ALIGNMENT FIXES - SEPTEMBER 6, 2025

## Overview
Comprehensive fixes to address button visibility and alignment issues across the MMWafrika e-commerce website, ensuring all interactive elements are clearly visible and properly aligned.

## Key Issues Addressed

### 1. Shopping Cart Badge Visibility
**Problem**: Cart item count badge was invisible or barely visible
**Solution**: 
- Enhanced badge styling with better contrast and positioning
- Added `bg-red-500` background with `text-white` for high visibility
- Used `absolute -top-2 -right-2` for proper positioning
- Added `shadow-lg` for better separation from background
- Implemented proper z-index with `z-50` for layering

### 2. Button Color Scheme Issues
**Problem**: Buttons with black text on dark backgrounds were invisible
**Solution**:
- Updated EmailSignupForm subscribe button to use `primaryDark` variant
- The `primaryDark` variant uses `bg-white text-black` for better visibility on dark backgrounds
- Added hover effects with `hover:bg-gray-100` for visual feedback

### 3. Add to Cart Button Styling
**Problem**: Add to Cart buttons lacked proper styling and visibility
**Solution**:
- Enhanced button styling with `bg-amber-600 hover:bg-amber-700 text-white`
- Added `shadow-md hover:shadow-lg` for depth and visual appeal
- Implemented smooth transitions with `transition-all duration-300`
- Added rounded corners with `rounded-lg` for modern appearance

### 4. Product Grid Alignment
**Problem**: Product cards weren't properly centered on the page
**Solution**:
- Removed fixed `max-w-[280px]` constraint on product cards
- Allowed grid to handle sizing naturally with `w-full` on card containers
- Added `mx-auto` to grid container for proper centering
- Implemented `justify-items-center` for consistent alignment

### 5. Component Consistency
**Problem**: Inconsistent button styling across different components
**Solution**:
- Unified button styling through shadcn Button component
- Ensured all buttons use consistent variants and sizing
- Implemented proper variant mapping for different use cases
- Added proper className merging with `cn()` utility
