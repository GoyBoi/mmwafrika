**Issue**: Several components were importing shadcn UI components without the `.jsx` extension
**Resolution**: Updated all shadcn UI component imports to include the `.jsx` extension

### 3. Router Context Error
**Issue**: The `useRoutes()` error due to missing `<Router>` context wrapper
**Resolution**: Updated `App.js` to properly wrap the application with `<Router>` component
