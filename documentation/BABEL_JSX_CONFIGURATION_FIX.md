# Babel JSX Configuration Fix

## Problem
The development server was showing an error:
```
Module build failed (from ./node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js):
SyntaxError: /home/zoro/Desktop/Omak_AI/Qwen Chat/Web Dev/mmwafrika/src/index.js: Support for the experimental syntax 'jsx' isn't currently enabled (8:3):

   6 | const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
   7 | root.render(
>  8 |   <React.StrictMode>
     |   ^
   9 |     <Root />
  10 |   </React.StrictMode>
  11 | );
```

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a conflict between two Babel configuration methods:
1. Both `babel.config.js` file and webpack configuration were trying to configure Babel
2. The webpack configuration was overriding the `babel.config.js` file

## Solution Implemented
1. Verified that `@babel/preset-react` was installed as a dev dependency
2. Confirmed that `babel.config.js` existed with the correct configuration:
   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     presets: [
       '@babel/preset-env',
       ['@babel/preset-react', { runtime: 'automatic' }]
     ]
   };
   ```
3. Simplified the webpack configuration to rely solely on the `babel.config.js` file by removing the Babel options from the webpack config

## Files Modified
1. `webpack.config.js` - Removed Babel options from the loader configuration to avoid conflicts

## Verification
After implementing the fix:
1. The development server starts successfully on port 3001
2. The bundle.js file is generated without Babel JSX errors
3. React components are properly transformed and rendered

## Key Takeaways
1. Configuration conflicts: Having Babel configuration in both `babel.config.js` and webpack can cause conflicts
2. Single source of truth: It's better to have Babel configuration in one place (`babel.config.js`)
3. Webpack simplicity: Webpack's babel-loader will automatically load Babel configuration files
