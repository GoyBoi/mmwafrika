Rather than attempting a complete overhaul, implement enhancements incrementally with continuous user feedback.

### 3. Focus on Performance Optimization
Ensure that all new features are implemented with performance considerations to maintain fast loading times.

### 4. Establish User Testing Protocol
Create a framework for continuous user testing to validate that psychological selling elements are effective without being off-putting.

### 5. Create Content Strategy
Develop a content strategy that authentically represents African culture and heritage while appealing to the target market.
