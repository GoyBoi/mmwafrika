# MMWafrika E-commerce Project

This document provides an overview of the MMWafrika e-commerce frontend project, including setup instructions, development conventions, and progress tracking.

## Project Overview

This is a simple e-commerce website frontend built with React. The project uses Webpack for bundling and Babel for JavaScript transpilation.

## Initial Setup

1.  **Node.js Project Initialization**: Created `package.json` with `npm init -y`.
2.  **Dependencies Installation**:
    *   Installed React and ReactDOM as core dependencies.
    *   Installed Webpack, Babel, and related tools as development dependencies.
3.  **Project Structure**:
    *   Created `.gitignore` to exclude `node_modules`, `dist`, and `.env` files.
    *   Configured Babel with `@babel/preset-env` and `@babel/preset-react`.
    *   Set up Webpack configuration for bundling and development server.
    *   Created `public/index.html` as the main HTML template.
    *   Created `src/index.js` as the entry point and `src/App.js` for the main App component.
4.  **Development Server**: Configured `webpack-dev-server` to run on port 3000.

## Technology Stack Enhancements

We've recently enhanced our technology stack with modern tools and best practices:

1.  **Styling**: Added Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.
2.  **Component Library**: Integrated Material-UI (MUI) for pre-built components.
3.  **Routing**: Implemented React Router for navigation.
4.  **Code Quality**: Added ESLint and Prettier for code formatting and linting.
5.  **Project Structure**: Reorganized the project based on features.

## Recent Additions

1.  **Product Listing Page**: Created a product listing page to display products in a grid layout.
2.  **Product Data**: Added mock product data with images, names, and prices.
3.  **Navigation**: Implemented navigation from the homepage to the product listing page.
4.  **Shopping Cart Functionality**: 
    *   Created a shopping cart context for state management
    *   Added functionality to add products to the cart
    *   Display the number of items in the cart in the header
    *   Created a cart page to view and manage items
    *   Implemented functionality to update item quantities and remove items

## UI/UX Improvements

We've recently made significant improvements to the website's UI/UX:

1.  **Product Cards**: Fixed sizing and spacing issues, improved image display with consistent aspect ratios, enhanced hover effects with smooth transitions and shadows.
2.  **Homepage**: Improved whitespace and alignment, enhanced typography with responsive font sizes, improved button styling with better hover effects.
3.  **Cart Page**: Fixed layout issues, improved table design, enhanced button styling, better responsive design.
4.  **Checkout Page**: Improved form layout, enhanced stepper component, fixed order summary section, improved button styling.
5.  **Responsive Design**: Tested and optimized the website for mobile, tablet, and desktop views, improved layouts to adapt to different screen sizes.

## Development Conventions

*   **Component Structure**: React components are organized in the `src/components` directory. Pages are in `src/pages`.
*   **Styling**: Using a combination of Tailwind CSS utilities and Material-UI components for styling.
*   **State Management**: For now, we're using React's built-in state management (useState, useContext). We may introduce Redux or Context API later if needed.
*   **Code Quality**: All code should pass ESLint and Prettier checks before being committed.

## Running the Project

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the webpack-dev-server on http://localhost:3000.

To build the project for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` folder with the bundled files.

To check for code quality issues, run:

```bash
npx eslint src/
```

To automatically fix code formatting issues, run:

```bash
npx prettier --write src/
```

## Preview

The project has been successfully built. You can preview the built project by serving the `dist` folder. 

To serve the project locally, you can use a tool like `serve`:

```bash
npx serve dist
```

This will start a local server and provide a URL where you can preview the built project.
